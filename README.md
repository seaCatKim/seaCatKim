Hi there! I'm a Lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology. I’m interested in coral reefs 🌊🥽, data science, and teaching. My research as a part of the [Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program](https://gbrrestoration.org/) is on modelling coral rubble risk across the Great Barrier Reef and assessing risk of novel interventions. 

### What am I up to? 

- 👩‍🏫 I teach the Geospatial Information Science course at Queensland University of Technology and am an organizer of the [Brisbane Geospatial Community of Practice](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/about/).

- 💻 I'm leading the development of a Flood Vulnerability Index for Brisbane City following the Digital Mud Hackathon in the aftermath of the 2022 floods in Brisbane. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git for version control(!), Rmarkdown products, and quarto.

### Recognition

- 2022: Best Poster, Queensland University of Technology Early Career Research Symposium
- 2022: Finalist, Queensland Women in STEM Awards

### Community

- Co-Organizer, [Brisbane Geospatial Community of Practice](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/about/)
- Co-Organizer, [R-Ladies Brisbane](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_brisbane#welcome-to-r-ladies-brisbane) 
- I regularly contribute to R training in Brisbane at Research Bazaar Queensland. I've also developed and led 2 sessions at ResBaz on building a community of practice website using R.

### Education
